# The Decentralized Travel Guide (AnonVeil)

#### The website is a sample website built around helping users to hire and chat with guides as they plan to travel to cities or countries.

#### The website utilizes Walletchat to chat with guides anonymously. This helps protect the privacy of traveller and guide and prevent snooping.

#### Users type in where they plan to go and list of guides knowing the city or country pops up, the potential traveller clicks on a card and get walletchat widget to popup and then chats can begin between the guide and the traveller on the blockchain.

#### There are two types of guides, the paid and the free. The paid requires you to pay some usdc before you can access their wallet address to chat,clicking this autmatically trigger a metamask popup to transfer the required usdc to the user.

#### The rest of the action takes place in the widget

## Ways to improve this demo site:

- Allow every wallet aside metamask using wagmi or rainbow
- Save data on db on those who already paid to avoid them paying each time they click on the card
- Allow guides to register with a popup form
- Move db from json to mongodb or postgresql
